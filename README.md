#Flex-Grid

Flex-Grid is meant to be a very simple flexbox based CSS grid framework. It is meant to be very lightweight.

Please be careful using this in production, as IE has limited support and there is no fallback. Please visit [Can I Use](http://caniuse.com/#search=flex) for more information.

Like many other frameworks, this uses a twelve column grid. 

Flex-Grid also makes it incredibly easy to change the defaults, such as max-width and margins.
